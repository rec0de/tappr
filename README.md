Tappr is a minimalist arcade game for SailfishOS.

Want to play? It's really simple.
See those white rectangles? Tap those.
See the background? Don't tap this.

Eliminate all white tiles before they get out of sigth. You get 1 Point for each destroyed tile.
On the cover you see your highscore and your rank in the worldwide highscore-list.

Feel free to customize, remix and publish this app. But please note that the code isn't the most efficient one since I don't know much aubout this object-oriented magic stuff...

Have fun.
