Tappr is a minimalist arcade game for SailfishOS.

Want to play? It's really simple.
See those white rectangles? Tap those.
See the background? Don't tap that.

Eliminate all white tiles before they get out of sight. You get 1 point for each tapped tile.
On the cover you see your highscore and your rank in the worldwide highscore list.

Feel free to customize, remix and publish this app. But please note that the code isn't the most efficient one since I don't know much aubout this object-oriented magic stuff...
Update: Didn't know. Too lazy to rewrite the code, though.

Have fun.
